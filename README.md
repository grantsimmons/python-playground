## Webscrape Testing
This webscrape will retrieve numerical data from a website URL and generate a CSV file.
Other tools in this directory can be used to visualize the generated CSV file.

This set of tools is intended to serve as my contribution to the Stevens Institute of Technology Design VI course.

I pledge my honor that I have abided by the Stevens Honor System.
